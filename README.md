### Slice ###
- slice is an abstraction of an Array
- slices are more flexible and powerful: variable-length or get an sub arrya of its own
- slices are also index based and have a size, but is resized when needed


### append ###
- Adds the element(s) at the end of the slice
- Grows the slice if a greater capacity is needed and return the updated slicer value

### loops ###
- In general, languages provide various control structures to control the application flow
- A loop statement allows us to execute code multiple times, in a loop
- loops are simplified in Go, we only have the "for loop" for loops
 - #### For-Each" loop ####
  - iterating over a list

### range ###
- Range iterates over elements for different data structures ( not only for arrays and slices)

### Blank Identifier "_" ###
- To ignore a variable you don't want to use
- So with Go you need to make unused variables explicit
